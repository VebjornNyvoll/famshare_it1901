# restapi
TODO

Our restserver is a Spring Boot application, where the rest-API/mappings for HTTP-requests are defined in RestServerController.

**Restapi** contains the restserver, with the following classes:

- FamshareApplication

- ApiCalendarController

- ApiCalendar

In this module you will also find files with configuration for the server under **resources**, such as which port and storage location the server should use. In addition to application.properties, which is used for all running, there is also an application-test.properties, which is used during the tests, both in this module, as well as integrationtests.
